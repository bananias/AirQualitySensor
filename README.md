# AirQualitySensor

Little piece of code to create an Air Quality Sensor and push data over 4 endpoints :

local MQTT server (to integrate into your HA server, or others ...)
OpenSenseMap : https://opensensemap.org/
Sensor.Community : https://maps.sensor.community/
AQICN : https://aqicn.org/
Sorry if the code is not clean, I am not a dev ... just a poor boy trying to do his best ... All help is welcome :)
